### IWPT 2021: The 17th International Conference on Parsing Technologies
August 6, 2021, at ACL-IJCNLP 2021 (virtual)

<https://iwpt21.sigparse.org/>

&nbsp;

## CALL FOR PAPERS

The ACL Special Interest Group on Natural Language Parsing (SIGPARSE) invites submissions to its biennial conference on parsing technologies. IWPT 2021 will be the 17th conference in a series that started in 1989. The conference will be held as a virtual event at ACL-IJCNLP 2021 on August 6, 2021.

### INVITED SPEAKER

Emily Pitler, Google AI


### TOPICS

IWPT addresses all aspects of structural analysis of natural language,
including but not limited to:

+ Parsing of natural language (phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic, discourse, etc.)
+ Formal models and algorithms for recognition, parsing and transduction
+ Machine learning techniques for syntax and parsing
+ Complexity of languages, models and algorithms
+ Learning of recursive structure (linguistic/latent)
+ Parsing in machine translation (synchronous parsing; alignment by parsing; translation by parsing, etc.)
+ Cognitive models of language processing
+ Multilingual and multimodal perspectives on syntax and parsing
+ Domain and genre adaptation, portability and robustness of parsing systems
+ Practical applications of parsing technology
+ Parser evaluation (across languages and frameworks)
+ Neural network models for linguistic structure prediction
+ Combining distributional and symbolic signals for linguistic structure prediction
+ Syntactic typology for multilingual modeling
+ Parsing low-resource languages and cross-lingual or domain transfer
+ Interpretation of linguistic structure in deep learning models
+ Integration of morphology via character-based models, subword embeddings, and beyond


### IWPT 2021 SHARED TASK

Continuing the series of parsing-oriented shared tasks established at IWPT 2020, the 2021 IWPT Shared Task will be on Multilingual Parsing into Enhanced Universal Dependendies.

+ Notification of acceptance: May 31, 2021
+ Camera-ready versions due: June 7, 2021
+ Conference: August 6, 2021
