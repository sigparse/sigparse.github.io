<h5 id="i-statement-of-purpose">I. Statement of Purpose</h5>
<p>The purpose of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Special Interest Group in natural language parsing (SIGPARSE) shall be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To promote interest in the parsing of natural languages.</li>
  <li>To provide members of the ACL having a special interest in natural language parsing with a means of exchanging news of recent research developments and other matters of interest in natural language parsing.</li>
  <li>To ensure continuity of the biennial series of conferences called International Conference in Parsing Technology (IWPT).</li>
  <li>To sponsor meetings and workshops related to natural language parsing that appear to be timely and worthwhile.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="ii-membership">II. Membership</h5>
<p>Membership is open to anyone who professes an interest in the parsing of natural languages. Membership will be terminated on request, or automatically if no reply is received within six months of posting a membership list update message.</p>

<h5 id="iii-elected-officers">III. Elected Officers</h5>
<p>The elected officers of the SIG shall consist of a President, a Secretary and up to four Information Officers.</p>

<p>The term of all elected officers of the SIG shall be 3 years.</p>

<p>The duties of the President shall be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To have primary executive authority over actions and activities of the SIG.</li>
  <li>To prepare a written report on the activities of the SIG for the Executive Committee of the ACL, for presentation to the ACL at its Annual Business Meeting.</li>
  <li>To designate such other officers as may be needed from time to time to fulfill the goals of the SIG, in particular a returning officer as specified in Sections IV and VI below.</li>
</ul>

<p>The duties of the Secretary shall be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To maintain a membership roster of the SIG.</li>
  <li>To be responsible for any moneys awarded to the SIG by the ACL; to collect and manage any dues that may be required by the organization; and to present a written annual report on the SIG finances to the Executive Committee of the ACL.</li>
  <li>To maintain, in consultation with the President and the Information Officers, a document stating the aims of the group and the names and affiliations of the current officers, suitable for sending to prospective members and other inquirers.</li>
</ul>

<p>The duties of the Information Officers shall be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To communicate with members of the SIG.</li>
  <li>To answer inquiries about the SIG.</li>
  <li>To make up-to-date information of relevance to the SIG members available from the SIGPARSE website.
Any other specific duties agreed upon.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="iv-election-of-officers">IV. Election of Officers</h5>
<p>All officers of the SIG shall be elected by a vote of its membership. Elections shall normally take place at least one month before the expiration of current terms of office. In the event of a casual vacancy, an extraordinary election shall be held for an officer to complete the current term of office. Candidates must be nominated by two members, must accept nomination, and must be members in good standing of both ACL and SIGPARSE.</p>

<p>Votes may be entered by electronic or physical mail, and votes arriving by the notified closing date will be counted by a returning officer appointed by the President and agreed to by all candidates. Nominations shall be called at least three months prior to the election, and shall close two months prior to the election. All members shall be notified of the election date and the nominations at least four weeks prior to the close of voting, and results shall be notified to the members within four weeks after the close of voting.</p>

<p>Notification shall signify dispatch of mail by the medium and to the address last notified to the secretary.</p>

<h5 id="v-dues">V. Dues</h5>
<p>Subject to the approval of the Executive Committee of the ACL the SIG may levy annual membership dues, where the rate is determined by the Executive Committee. In certain circumstances, the Executive Committee may decide to waive the fee. No dues shall be assessed for 2007 or 2008.</p>

<h5 id="vi-referenda">VI. Referenda</h5>
<p>A change to this constitution, or a motion on any other matter, may be initiated by five members (petitioners) in writing or by agreement of the President and Secretary (on the suggestion of a member or otherwise). The motions will be put to the members within six months of receipt of a petition, if the petitioners so request. Otherwise, constitutional amendments and other motions will be put to the vote in conjunction with the regular elections.</p>

<p>Members will be given notification at least three months in advance of any referendum, and further motions or amendments proposed by two members shall be accepted up to two months before the close of voting. Votes may be entered by electronic or physical mail, and votes arriving by the notified closing date will be counted by a returning officer appointed by the President and agreed to by all petitioners. All members shall be notified of the date of the referendum and the proposed motions and amendments at least four weeks prior to the close of voting, and results shall be notified to the members within four weeks of the close of voting.</p>

<p>Any change to this constitution requires a two-thirds majority of the SIGPARSE membership and is subject to approval by ACL. Any other matter requires a simple majority of those actually voting.</p>

<p>Notification shall signify dispatch of mail by the medium and to the address last notified to the secretary.
This constitution, drafted by Harry Bunt in May 2007, was approved in a SIGPARSE business meeting on June 23, 2007 in Prague.</p>
